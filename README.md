# Time_Series_Analysis

In order to estimate future demand, we do time series analysis. We try to understand the pattern shown by past data and try to predict the future. FbProphet is an open source library from Facebook which helps us to do Time Series Anlaysis. 

It is very easy to use and gives much better results as compared to other libraries like ARIMA and Seasonal ARIMA.

I have performed time series analysis on a dataset which shows beer production in Australia on a monthly basis from 1956 till 1995.

You can download the code and try it yourself. For practice, I have attached 2 more datasets.

Tools used:

  Python
  FbProphet

To load fbprophet, run these 2 commands first in your terminal.

  pip install pystan
  conda install -c conda-forge fbprophet
